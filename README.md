# 03 JavaScript: Jenny's Password Generator

## Description

My Challenge requires modifying starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Usage

To use this Password Generator, you can click on the Generate password button and follow the prompts.
